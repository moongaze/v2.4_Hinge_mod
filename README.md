- 8x M3x16 sockethead
- 8x M3 T-nuts

- 4x M3 hex nuts (To secure the door)
- 4x M3 washer (To secure the door)

## Info:

**The print parts are intended for PLA** (ABS shrink is not accounted for), and a **total panel thickness of 6mm**. This includes the foam gasket.
So different configurations are possible e.g. 4mm door panel + 2mm foam, or 3mm door panel + 3mm foam.
I intentionally undersized the parts touching the panels by 0.3mm to compress the foam and ensure airtightness.


**The STL files are for a right side mount**

**For a left side mount and alternate versions check the CAD files**

To insert the LM6UU bearings, I've used a small hammer. It's a tight fit. YMMV.
